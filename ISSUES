1. namevar has to be name for parsedfile
This has been fixed (although I am not sure how)

2. parse_title fails when it cant parse the title
#7625

hash to resource ? it is adding a title?


this is really different from how namevar works, the title defaults to overriding our attributes? what about aliases and what-not?

Is there no differentiation between namevar and title for composite namevars?


CODE:
resources { 'limits':
  purge => true
}
#host { 'foo':
#  ip => '127.0.0.2'
#}
limits { 'dan/hard/foo':
  domain => 'bob',
  value => '4'
}
FILE:
bob soft items 4
dan hard foo 4

the dan line should be delete, byt instead, a bob line is added and it stays
